##### Configuration:
Steps to configure your `Muthofun` Sms Gateway!

In config/initializers (for Ruby on Rails) file create a muthofun.rb file and configure your
credentials. For other ruby based frameworks or raw ruby project, simply setup the configuration in
any file.

```ruby
MuthofunApi.configuration do |config|
  config.client_id  = 'abcdef'
  config.secret_key = 'helloworld'
  config.originator = '01844016400'
end      
```


## How to send sms
Once you are done with your credential setup you are ready to go
you can send sms using the following command.

```ruby
result = MuthofunApi::SmsAccount.send_sms('8801766678130', 'Hello Bidhu from Irfan')
pp result.output
pp result.success?
pp result.failed?
pp result.error
pp result.error_description
pp result.error_code
```
But if you want to do something when sms is sent successfully you can use a block like the following snippets!

```ruby
a = MuthofunApi::SmsAccount.send_sms('8801766678130', 'Hello Bidhu from Irfan') do |result|
  # Only executes when sending sms is successful!
  pp result.output
  pp result.success?
  pp result.failed?
  pp result.error
  pp result.error_description
  pp result.error_code
end
```
